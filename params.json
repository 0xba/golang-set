This is my attempt to mimic the primary features of the set from Python.\r\nYou can of course argue that there is no need for a set in Go, otherwise the creators would have added one to the standard library.  To those I say simply ignore this repository\r\nand carry-on and to the rest that find this useful please contribute in helping me make it better by:\r\n\r\n* Helping to make more idiomatic improvements to the code.\r\n* Helping to make it better for more generic use across types.\r\n* Helping to increase the performance of it. (So far, no attempt has been made, but since it uses a map internally, I expect it to be mostly performant.)\r\n* Helping to make the unit-tests more robust and kick-ass.\r\n* Helping to fill in the [documentation.](http://godoc.org/github.com/deckarep/golang-set)\r\n* Simply offering feedback and suggestions, since I am a Go n00b.  (Positive, constructive feedback is appreciated.)\r\n\r\nI have to give some credit for helping seed the idea with this post on [stackoverflow.](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/177428/sets-data-structure-in-golang)\r\n\r\nPlease see the unit test file for additional usage examples.  The Python set documentation will also do a better job than I can of explaining how a set typically [works.](http://docs.python.org/2/library/sets.html)    Please keep in mind \r\nhowever that the Python set is a built-in type and supports additional features and syntax that make it awesome.  This set for Go is nowhere near as comprehensive as the Python set\r\nalso, this set has not been battle-tested or used in production.  Also, this set is not goroutine safe...you have been warned.\r\n\r\nExamples but not exhaustive\r\n```go\r\nrequiredClasses := NewSet()\r\nrequiredClasses.Add(\"Cooking\")\r\nrequiredClasses.Add(\"English\")\r\nrequiredClasses.Add(\"Math\")\r\nrequiredClasses.Add(\"Biology\")\r\n\r\nscienceClasses := NewSet()\r\nscienceClasses.Add(\"Biology\")\r\nscienceClasses.Add(\"Chemistry\")\r\n\r\nelectiveClasses := NewSet()\r\nelectiveClasses.Add(\"Welding\")\r\nelectiveClasses.Add(\"Music\")\r\nelectiveClasses.Add(\"Automotive\")\r\n\r\nbonusClasses := NewSet()\r\nbonusClasses.Add(\"Go Programming\")\r\nbonusClasses.Add(\"Python Programming\")\r\n\r\n//Show me all the available classes I can take\r\nallClasses := requiredClasses.Union(scienceClasses).Union(electiveClasses).Union(bonusClasses)\r\nfmt.Println(allClasses) //Set{English, Chemistry, Automotive, Cooking, Math, Biology, Welding, Music, Go Programming}\r\n\r\n//Is cooking considered a science class?\r\nfmt.Println(scienceClasses.Contains(\"Cooking\")) //false\r\n\r\n//Show me all classes that are not science classes, since I hate science.\r\nfmt.Println(allClasses.Difference(scienceClasses)) //Set{English, Automotive, Cooking, Math, Welding, Music, Go Programming}\r\n\r\n//Which science classes are also required classes?\r\nfmt.Println(scienceClasses.Intersect(requiredClasses)) //Set{Biology}\r\n\r\n//How many bonus classes do you offer?\r\nfmt.Println(bonusClasses.Size()) //2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Ralph\r\n\r\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/deckarep/golang-set/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
